	    <h1>DrupalDeb: APT packages for Drupal modules</h1>

		    Email address, github and donation button coming soon. 
	    </div>
	    <p>This is a very simple application to package up Drupal modules
	    as .deb packages and export them as an APT repository.  You can
	    request a new module, and the application will build it for you and
	    add it to the repository within ten minutes.</p>
	    <p>These modules are designed to work with the Debian/Ubuntu
	    drupal6 package.  They currently do not upgrade, though that is on
	    the TODO list (see below).  They also are installed in the core
	    directory, so they will apply to all your sites.</p>
	    <p><b>This site is in alpha, developed entirely during DrupalCamp
		    Toronto 2010, don't expect much.</b></p> 
	    <p>Add the following line(s) to your sources.list to use:</p>
	    <p><blockquote><tt>deb http://drupaldeb.org/debian recommended main</tt></blockquote></p>
	    <p><blockquote><tt>deb http://drupaldeb.org/debian developer main</tt></blockquote></p>
	    <p><a href="/releases">View all of the modules in the repository</a></p>
	    <p><a href="/releases/new">Add a new module</a></p>

	    <p>TODO:</p>
	    <ul>
		    <li>Add automatic updating of modules</li>
		    <li>Add signing of packages</li>
		    <li>Make modules depend on drush and automatically execute update.php</li>
		    <li>Package core</li>
	    </ul>
